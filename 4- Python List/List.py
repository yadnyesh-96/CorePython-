#In Python, a list is a built-in data structure 
# that can hold an ordered collection of items.

#Can contain duplicate items
#Mutable: items can be modified, replaced, or removed
#Ordered: maintains the order in which items are added
# Index-based: items are accessed using their position (starting from 0)
# Can store mixed data types (integers, strings, booleans, even other lists)
